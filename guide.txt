1) create project folder
2) create environement
3) make subfolder = input_videos
4) put the example video in it 
5) create new file yolo_inference.py for experimenting with yolo
6) run yolo_inference.py, this will download the yolo model, but only the first time
7) create a new folder 'training' to fine tune the yolo model with a good labelled images of referee, ball and players
8) create a notebook and write code
9) put the notebook in colab to use their gpu to train
10) download the best and last weights and put it in newly created models folder
11) use models/best.pt in yolo_inference.py instead of yolovx
12) run yolo_inference.py, another folder will be created in runs/ you will notice that now output is showing referee too
13) to make annotations beautiful(ellipses etc), Create main.py
14) Create utils/video_utils.py, write code, create init.py in utils
15) create output_videos folder, run main.py, it saves the video as it is
16) to make tracking happen, create trackers folder, add init which exposes the classes and functions to outside the tracker folder and tracker.py in it
17) write code in tracker.py and then in init
18) write code for tracker in main.py
19) and then again in tracker.py write code to convert goalkeeper to player object and more code for other things
20) and then again run main.py finally, now it will now store the stub for the input video
21) Write some more code in tracker.py
22) create bbox utils file in utils for ellipse construction and write some more in tracker.py
23) run the main.py, this will create a video in output_videos with ellipse below player 
24) write some more in tracker.py for little rectangle on ellipse which marks player's numberxx
25) write some more to draw triangle on ball in tracker.py
26) create development_and_analysis/color_assignment.ipynb to distinguish teams
27) go back to main.py and write a code to save cropped image of player in the first frame of the video
28) start writing code in color_assignment.ipynb
29) create folder team_assigner, create init.py in it, create team_assigner.py , write code in both
30) write code in main.py
31) create player_ball_assigner for ball acquisition, then write code in main.py and tracker.py
32) create camera_movement_estimator, write code/ write code in tracker.py and main.py too
33) create view_transformers, write code
34) create speed_and_distance_estimator, write code
